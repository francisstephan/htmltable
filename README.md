# rust command line program to convert csv files to html and reverse

A small tool I built for fun and out of pure lazyness (it's so boring to write html tables by hand...).
Through CSV, the tool will also allow to convert between excel and html tables.

The html to csv part is a bit tricky; I do accept that `<table..`, `<tr..` and `<td..` tags may have some class or id or anything included, but I suppose that `</table>, </tr> and </td>` are present under this form. Also tags should be in lower case (`<tr>`, not `<TR>`). The parse will stop if invalid html is detected - but possibly some output will have been generated by that time, so check both the input and the output files.

## Directions for use
Program to build an html table from a list of lines with optional separator and conversely to convert html table to CSV (using comma or any separator character)

Usage: htmltable [OPTIONS] --input `<INPUT>` --output `<OUTPUT>`

Options:

  -i, --input `<INPUT>`        : Path of input file, relative to current path

  -o, --output `<OUTPUT>`        : Path of output file, relative to current path

  -s, --separator `<SEPARATOR>`  : Character to be used as separator in lines of input file [default: ' ']

  -r, --reverse                : Reverse mode (html to plain text with separator), default=false

  -h, --help                   : Print help

  -V, --version                : Print version

Concerning the separator character (',' for CSV), make sure that this separator is not present in the cell text...


## Example:
One sample file romaji.txt is provided

To test the program, try:

cargo run -- -i romaji.txt -o romaji.html

(using the default ' ', single space, as separator; in this case two spaces in a row mean one empty cell)


Then try to convert the resulting file to CSV:

cargo run -- -i romaji.html -o romaji.csv -s , -r

I used romaji.html, together with some CSS, in my [hkana program](https://eludev.fr/hkana/)
